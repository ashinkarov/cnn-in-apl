This directory contain multiple implementations of the CNN for handwritten
image recognition that follow Zhang's design.

The code is located in `cnn.apl`, and the input files are located under `input`
directory.  Note that if you are cloning the repo for the first time, you'd have
to manually download the MNIST data.

In order to run the code, you'd need to have an operational Dyalog APL
interpreter.  We have tried versions 16 and 17:
```bash
$ cat cnn.apl | dyalog
```
